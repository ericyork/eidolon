Just wanted to archive the old one so I can look at it in a year and cringe hard. (Also wanted to write a post where I try out the built-in figure generation in the jekyll theme to see if I want to keep it when I build my own). ***Later...*** OK, so I don't know if I imagined that feature or what, but I can't find it anywhere so here goes anyhow.

### Old logo

<a href="{{ "/assets/images/logo-lg.png" | absolute_url }}">![Old Logo]({{ "/assets/images/logo-lg.png" | absolute_url }})</a>

As you can see it has . . . issues. So, I decided for a quick redesign. Still not at the point where I want to actually design the final logo so for now this is just a marginally more acceptable placeholder for an actual logo.

### New logo

<a href="{{ "/assets/images/eid-logo.svg" | absolute_url }}">![Old Logo]({{ "/assets/images/eid-logo.svg" | absolute_url }})</a>

I hope it's an upgrade. I made the stone statue of a person look more like an actual person instead of like an alien glyphic drawn by an illiterate gibbering horror from beyond space-time. I also created it as vectors and used .svg instead of the original .png and this made for a big improvement, I think.
