Where to begin? Or more properly, where *did* it begin? This is question that has long occupied writers and writing theorists, perhaps best expressed as a paradox by E.M. Forester: "How can I know what I know until I see what I say?" This is the paradox of beginning, yet, deciding where and how a story begins is part of the awesome responsibility of writing.

>  *The Road goes ever on and on<br>
   Down from the door where it began.<br>
   Now far ahead the Road has gone,<br>
   And I must follow, if I can,<br>
   Pursuing it with eager feet,<br>
   Until it joins some larger way<br>
   Where many paths and errands meet.<br>
   And whither then? I cannot say.*

## In the beginning this wasn't even a project...

I was merely noodling around with different front-end development stacks while preparing to teach an advanced course in web development. That said, I'd long ago become disillusioned with my personal website and desired something different. Finally, after years and years of keeping all my projects on my local computer in different files and folders, after having fully weaned myself off of Word and other code-heavy applications, it was time to begin the project I had been envisioning for some time.
