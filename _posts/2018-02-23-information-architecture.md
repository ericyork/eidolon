This is just a simple workspace where I can try out different category and tag structures and, using git, keep track of everything fairly easily.

## Categories
+ **Eidos** - About. Stuff about me and the idea.
+ **Topoi** - Topics. New articles about current news and events related to tech and culture.
+ **Taxis** - Order. Archives of posts, categories, and tags.
+ **Lexis** - Grammar. Writing: finished, works-in-progress, and notes. Designs.
+ **Techne** - Tools. Information about development tools and methods. Technical info.
+ **Poroi** - Pathways. References, dev tool resources, publication venues, tutorials.
+ **Dolos** - Tricks. Tutorials, teaching materials, links to learning resources.
