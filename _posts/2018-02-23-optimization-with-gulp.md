**Update:** oh, and another thing. There is a great article about SSI and cookies that also happens to contain some great resources for optimization. It's called ["Using SSI to Detect Cookies"](https://mademistakes.com/til/using-ssi/). In a nutshell, these are the tools I'd want to explore:
+ [loadcss](https://github.com/filamentgroup/loadCSS)
+ [Critical](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical)
+ [Enhance.js](https://github.com/filamentgroup/enhance)
+ and a series of [Gulp tasks](https://github.com/mmistakes/made-mistakes-jekyll/tree/master/gulp/tasks)


Also, there's an excellent discussion on the below assets on MadeMistake, this time the excellent article ["How I'm Using Jekyll in 2017"](https://mademistakes.com/articles/using-jekyll-2017/)

+ [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and [gulp-sass](https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass): natively compile SCSS files to CSS.
+ [gulp-autoprefixer](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-autoprefixer): vendor prefix CSS.
+ [gulp-cssnano](https://github.com/ben-eb/gulp-cssnano): minify CSS.
+ [gulp-concat](https://github.com/contra/gulp-concat): concatenate JavaScript.
+ [gulp-uglify](https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify): minify JavaScript with UglifyJS.
+ [gulp-sourcemaps](https://github.com/gulp-sourcemaps/gulp-sourcemaps): add source maps for CSS and JS.
+ [gulp-gzip](https://github.com/jstuckey/gulp-gzip): gzip CSS and JS.
+ [gulp-rev](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-rev): append hash to CSS and JS filenames for cache busting.
